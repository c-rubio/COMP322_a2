                As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
                <span class="text_underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
                <span class="highlight_orange">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
                In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,

                <span class="text_red_emphasis">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower

                even when he is asleep..."</span>
                And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
                <span class="text_underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
